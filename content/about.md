Hello! My name is Sam Hood. I'm a computer science and information security student in Texas, currently wrapping up his first year of full time university.
My main areas of interest are operating systems, embedded systems, and compilers. My main programming languages are C/++, Rust, and Zig, plus occassional 
flirtation with web technologies.

If you want to get in contact with me, you can email me at `sjdh AT sjdh DOT us`. You can also find me on [keybase](https://keybase.io/sjdh02).
