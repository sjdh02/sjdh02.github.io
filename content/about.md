Hello! My name is Sam Hood. I'm a computer science student from Texas, wrapping up my first full year of University. My main areas of interest
are programming language theory, type theory, and compiler engineering. My main programming languages are C/++ and Haskell, along with some
newer systems languages like Zig and, to a lesser extent, Rust.

If you want to get in contact with me, you can email me at `sjdh AT sjdh DOT us`. You can also find me on [keybase](https://keybase.io/sjdh02).
