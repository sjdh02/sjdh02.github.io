The spring semester has officialy ended for me, and I've recently begun the process of relocating to attend my universities main campus for the rest of my undergrad degree. While I'll be quiet for most of this summer (and I'm sure a bit into the fall), I do plan to expand the scope of this blog as well as write more. I think of this as more of a personal journal, rather than a fully technical oriented blog. I plan to cover a wider range of topics in the future, so if you're interested, stay tuned for that.
