Time for another week log.

Compiler:

* As this was finals week at my University, I was unable to do much work on the compiler. I stubbed out some of the logic
  for the analyzer, and made plans to move from a tokenizer/parser combo to a streaming parser. This should simplify some
  of the logic in the parser.
  
Website:

* Moved over one old entry, as requested in an e-mail. I will likely move the rest over this coming week,
  along with one or two new entries.

Reading:

* I began Crime and Punishment this week, and read the majority of Part I. Like other Russian literature I've
  read, it has a certain way with intricate wording that is quite enjoyable, if a little tiring.
  
That's it for this week. As ususal, you can always contact me 
at `sjdh AT sjdh DOT us` or find me on [keybase](https://keybase.io/sjdh02).
