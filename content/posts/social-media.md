Lately, I've seen what seems like a rise in people who are taking breaks or alltogether leaving social media platforms for one reason or another. I've never been fond of it either - I use Reddit and Snapchat exclusively - but I've never taken the time to lay out some thoughts on why. I figured this would be a good start to expanding the variety of content on my page here, so lets get into it.


I find that many social media platforms encourage group-think. Social media platforms seem to bring out the more, er, "tribalistic" side in many people, resulting in them instantly attacking anyone who disagrees with them. On top of this, when someone makes a post that recieves likes (or whatever the sites name of choice is), it creates a positive-feedback loop, which leads them to say more things like whatever got them the attention in the first place. Inversely, if they make a post that recieves no attention or negative attention, they are likely to shy away from posting anything like it again. Ultimately, this leads to a lack of diversity in opinions, which stifles discussion - the supposed point of social media to begin with.

Social media can also become a pretty serious time sink. Its easy to just browse whatever to pass the time, when you could be doing something more useful.

Lastly, privacy. Social media companies seem to not really care that much about their users privacy - see Facebook for an example of this. Twitter is very unlikely to be any better, nor is any other social media platform.

Anywho, there were some short thoughts on why I don't really care for social media.
