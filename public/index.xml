      <description>Hello! My name is Sam Hood. I&amp;rsquo;m a computer science and information security student in Texas, currently wrapping up his first year of full time university. My main areas of interest are operating systems, embedded systems, and compilers. My main programming languages are C/++, Rust, and Zig, plus occassional flirtation with web technologies.
If you want to get in contact with me, you can email me at sjdh AT sjdh DOT us.</description>

      <title>Writing Recursively Defined Types in Rust</title>

      <description>Parsing is the step in the compilation of a program where individual tokens are grouped into expressions, which can then be further analyzed before being translated into machine code. In order to do this, sets of tokens must be identifiable as singular expressions, so that they may be grouped up to form meaning. My language is quite free-form when it comes to what expressions are allowed where (as are many), and representing this kind of freedom in a compiler&amp;rsquo;s source code is best done with recursive types.</description>

      <description>This commit is an example of a serious decision for any codebase: the decision to change the implementation language. This is more or less complicated for a given codebase depending on its size and who&amp;rsquo;s working on it. I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that trOS isn&amp;rsquo;t big and switching languages right now is far from a big problem - and it may never be. Nevertheless, given that it&amp;rsquo;s my main project right now, the language I use to write it matters a lot.</description>
