      <title>My Thoughts on Social Media</title>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve had some friends ask me why I don&amp;rsquo;t use social media outside of Reddit and Snapchat. Here are some general and loosely-connected thoughts on social media and what I don&amp;rsquo;t like about it.
The main reason I don&amp;rsquo;t care for social media is that it encourages group-think. There are plenty of examples of this; though Twitter is especially bad about it. Part of it is a human issue - many people are far too eager to attack someone who seemingly disagrees with them instead of having a discussion about it - but the other part of it lies within the social media network&amp;rsquo;s architecture.</description>

      <description>Now that the spring semester at my University has concluded, I&amp;rsquo;ve begun the process of relocating to an apartment near my Uni&amp;rsquo;s main campus to finish out my bachelors over the next few years. One thing that&amp;rsquo;s been awfully helpful to me in my process of moving is that I&amp;rsquo;ve always tried to minimize the number of things I own, which is a topic I might go into more detail on in another post.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Sam Hood, a computer science and math student from Texas. I&amp;rsquo;m currently in my second year of university, and my main interests lie in the areas of programming language theory, type systems, and compiler engineering. I&amp;rsquo;ve also done a good amount of embedded development in the past, as well as dabbling in operating systems. I have experience with both different programming languages and programming styles; however, I mainly subscribe to procedural and functional styles.</description>

      <title>Writing Recursively Defined Types in Rust</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say we&amp;rsquo;re writing a theoretical compiler, and we want to teach it how to parse some math expressions. Consider this snippet of source code:
(+ (- 20 10) 7)  In this example, we see a math expression. The operator in this case is +, and the operands are another math expression and 7. Internally, the compiler sees these operands as just two more distinct expressions (literals are a type of expression).</description>

      <title>Moving to Zig for ARM Development</title>

      <description>This commit is an example of a serious decision for any codebase: the decision to change the implementation language. This is more or less complicated for a given codebase depending on its size and who&amp;rsquo;s working on it. I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that trOS isn&amp;rsquo;t big and switching languages right now is far from a big problem - and it may never be. Nevertheless, given that it&amp;rsquo;s my main project right now, the language I use to write it matters a lot.</description>
