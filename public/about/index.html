<p>I&rsquo;m Sam Hood, a computer science and math student from Texas. I&rsquo;m currently in my second year of university, and my main interests lie in the areas of programming language theory, type systems, and compiler engineering. I&rsquo;ve also done a good amount of embedded development in the past, as well as dabbling in operating systems. I have experience with both different programming languages and programming styles; however, I mainly subscribe to procedural and functional sytles. My current main programming languages are C/++ and Haskell, however I have a small amount of experience in other functional languages like OCaml and Clojure, and more substantial experience in many other imperative languages. I also enjoy trying out new small languages; I currently enjoy working with <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a>, among others. If you want to contact me, I am avaiable via e-mail at the link below - feel free to request other ways to contact me, but I would prefer if you&rsquo;d use e-mail. Beyond that, this page also lists the hardware and software I use that I&rsquo;ve recieved questions about.</p>
