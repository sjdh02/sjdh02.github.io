      <description>Welcome to the first of the week log posts, wherein I go over what I got done this week regarding programming and such. One of these will be posted each Saturday or Sunday, depending on my schedule.
First off, the compiler:
 I&amp;rsquo;ve (mostly) completed messing about with the syntax for now, I quite like how its turned out.
 The parser is complete, though it took some time to get there.</description>
