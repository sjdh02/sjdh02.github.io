      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen what seems like a rise in people who are taking breaks or alltogether leaving social media platforms for one reason or another. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been fond of it either - I use Reddit and Snapchat exclusively - but I&amp;rsquo;ve never taken the time to lay out some thoughts on why. I figured this would be a good start to expanding the variety of content on my page here, so lets get into it.</description>

      <description>The spring semester has officialy ended for me, and I&amp;rsquo;ve recently begun the process of relocating to attend my universities main campus for the rest of my undergrad degree. While I&amp;rsquo;ll be quiet for most of this summer (and I&amp;rsquo;m sure a bit into the fall), I do plan to expand the scope of this blog as well as write more. I think of this as more of a personal journal, rather than a fully technical oriented blog.</description>
