      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve had some friends ask me why I don&amp;rsquo;t use social media outside of Reddit and Snapchat. Here are some general and loosely-connected thoughts on social media and what I don&amp;rsquo;t like about it.
The main reason I don&amp;rsquo;t care for social media is that it encourages group-think. There are plenty of examples of this; though Twitter is especially bad about it. Part of it is a human issue - many people are far too eager to attack someone who seemingly disagrees with them instead of having a discussion about it - but the other part of it lies within the social media network&amp;rsquo;s architecture.</description>
