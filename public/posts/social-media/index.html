    <p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve seen what seems like a rise in people who are taking breaks or alltogether leaving social media platforms for one reason or another. I&rsquo;ve never been fond of it either - I use Reddit and Snapchat exclusively - but I&rsquo;ve never taken the time to lay out some thoughts on why. I figured this would be a good start to expanding the variety of content on my page here, so lets get into it.</p>

<p>I find that many social media platforms encourage group-think. Social media platforms seem to bring out the more, er, &ldquo;tribalistic&rdquo; side in many people, resulting in them instantly attacking anyone who disagrees with them. On top of this, when someone makes a post that recieves likes (or whatever the sites name of choice is), it creates a positive-feedback loop, which leads them to say more things like whatever got them the attention in the first place. Inversely, if they make a post that recieves no attention or negative attention, they are likely to shy away from posting anything like it again. Ultimately, this leads to a lack of diversity in opinions, which stifles discussion - the supposed point of social media to begin with.</p>

<p>Social media can also become a pretty serious time sink. Its easy to just browse whatever to pass the time, when you could be doing something more useful.</p>

<p>Lastly, privacy. Social media companies seem to not really care that much about their users privacy - see Facebook for an example of this. Twitter is very unlikely to be any better, nor is any other social media platform.</p>

<p>Anywho, there were some short thoughts on why I don&rsquo;t really care for social media.</p>
