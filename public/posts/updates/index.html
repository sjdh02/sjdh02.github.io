    <p>Now that the spring semester at my University has concluded, I&rsquo;ve begun the process of relocating to
an apartment near my Uni&rsquo;s main campus to finish out my bachelors over the next few years. One thing
that&rsquo;s been awfully helpful to me in my process of moving is that I&rsquo;ve always tried to minimize the
number of things I own, which is a topic I might go into more detail on in another post. Compared to
some of the nightmares I&rsquo;ve seen from friends moving, I feel like my personal move is a walk in the park.
One of the things I plan on doing when I move is moving my website (and email (and other currently private
services)) to a self-hosted setup, or at least connecting my home-server to my VPS for expanded storage
capability, which I may use to host a few videos and such (I would rather avoid youtube for any video hosting).
Beyond that, I have some plans to write quite a bit more on here, from guides on programming languages/emacs
as well as more dialogue-esque ramblings on personal topics of varying importance, whether that be philosophical
or ideological opinions, and maybe even some opinions on modern issues.</p>
