    <p>The spring semester has officialy ended for me, and I&rsquo;ve recently begun the process of relocating to attend my universities main campus for the rest of my undergrad degree. While I&rsquo;ll be quiet for most of this summer (and I&rsquo;m sure a bit into the fall), I do plan to expand the scope of this blog as well as write more. I think of this as more of a personal journal, rather than a fully technical oriented blog. I plan to cover a wider range of topics in the future, so if you&rsquo;re interested, stay tuned for that.</p>
