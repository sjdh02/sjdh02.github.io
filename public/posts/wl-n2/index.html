Compiler:
 As this was finals week at my University, I was unable to do much work on the compiler. I stubbed out some of the logic for the analyzer, and made plans to move from a tokenizer/parser combo to a streaming parser. This should simplify some of the logic in the parser.   Website:
 Moved over one old entry, as requested in an e-mail."/>

    <p>Time for another week log.</p>

<p>Compiler:</p>

<ul>
<li>As this was finals week at my University, I was unable to do much work on the compiler. I stubbed out some of the logic
for the analyzer, and made plans to move from a tokenizer/parser combo to a streaming parser. This should simplify some
of the logic in the parser.
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Website:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moved over one old entry, as requested in an e-mail. I will likely move the rest over this coming week,
along with one or two new entries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reading:</p>

<ul>
<li>I began Crime and Punishment this week, and read the majority of Part I. Like other Russian literature I&rsquo;ve
read, it has a certain way with intricate wording that is quite enjoyable, if a little tiring.
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this week. As ususal, you can always contact me
at <code>sjdh AT sjdh DOT us</code> or find me on <a href="https://keybase.io/sjdh02">keybase</a>.</p>
