      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say we&amp;rsquo;re writing a theoretical compiler, and we want to teach it how to parse some math expressions. Consider this snippet of source code:
(+ (- 20 10) 7)  In this example, we see a math expression. The operator in this case is +, and the operands are another math expression and 7. Internally, the compiler sees these operands as just two more distinct expressions (literals are a type of expression).</description>

      <description>This commit is an example of a serious decision for any codebase: the decision to change the implementation language. This is more or less complicated for a given codebase depending on its size and who&amp;rsquo;s working on it. I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that trOS isn&amp;rsquo;t big and switching languages right now is far from a big problem - and it may never be. Nevertheless, given that it&amp;rsquo;s my main project right now, the language I use to write it matters a lot.</description>
